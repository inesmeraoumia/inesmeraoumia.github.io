I am currently a PhD Student at the IMAGES group of the [LTCI Lab] (https://www.telecom-paris.fr/fr/recherche/laboratoires/laboratoire-traitement-et-communication-de-linformation-ltci) in Télécom Paris (Institut Polytechnique de Paris), under the supervision of [Florence Tupin] (https://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/tupin/) and [Loïc Denis] (https://perso.univ-st-etienne.fr/deniloic/). I am currently working on Deep learning based methods for SAR image despeckling.

I received both my M.Sc. degree in Engineering from Télécom Paris, Institut Polytechnique de Paris, France where I majored in Image Processing and Data Science; and my M.Sc. in Applied Mathematics for Computer Vision from Ecole Normale Supérieure Paris-Saclay (Master MVA Mathématique Vision Apprentissage), France, in 2020. 

My main interests are inverse problem in image processing, and more particularly in denoising. I have mainly worked with Synthetic Aperture RADAR (SAR) images.
